title: The Greatest Common Divisor
---

The greatest common divisor of a set of numbers $x_1$ to $x_i$, commonly referred to as $\gcd(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_i)$ is an important tool in number theory.
I will outline a proof that shows that the $\gcd$ of two numbers, that is $\gcd(a,b)$ can be expressed as $\gcd(a,b)=an+bm$ for some $n,m$.<br>
Claim: $\gcd(a,b)=an+bm$ for some $n,m$.<br>
<h2> Proof </h2>
Denote $\gcd(a,b)$ as $d$. Recall that for any common divisor of $a$ and $b$, say $c$, the following is true : $c|ax+by$ for arbitrary $x$ and $y$. Since $d$ divides both $a$ and $b$, $d|ax+by$.<br>
We create a set $S$ that contains all positive combinations of $a,b$. We define it formally as $S={au+bv>0|u,v \in \mathbb{Z}}.$
