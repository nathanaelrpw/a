title: The Greatest Common Divisor
---

The greatest common divisor of a set of numbers $x_1$ to $x_i$, commonly referred to as $gcd(x_1,x_2,\dots,\x_i)$ is an important tool in number theory.
I will outline a proof that shows that the $gcd$ of two numbers, that is $gcd(a,b)$ can be expressed as $gcd(a,b)=ax+by$ for some $x,y$.
