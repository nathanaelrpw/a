title:Tips on solving organic chemistry schemes
---
It can be daunting as a beginner when you start encountering an overwhelming amount of organic chemistry schemes. It is my experience that I had some difficulty
solving scheme problems when I started out my olympiad journey, but as time went on I had more exposure to these problems, that they're now my favorite type of
problem. Perhaps before going into the <i>real</i> tips, I'd like to give a very crucial, yet often overlooked, aspect of learning organic chemistry.

<h2> 0. Read, read, read! </h2>
Seriously. This sounds like common sense, but reading is (arguably) the only way you'll get to learn new reactions. As you start doing scheme problems, you'll encounter
more reactions. However, you should always start by <u>actively</u> reading new reactions. I personally found Clayden's Organic Chemistry to be of tremendous help,
since the book was very clear in their mechanistic explanations. <br>
Ok, now the real advice.

<h2> 1. Don't take molecular formulas for granted. </h2>
Molecular formulas are one of the many useful informations you get while deducing organic schemes. Weird and unexpected reactions occur 99% of the time, and this is
why you should pay attention to the provided molecular formulas: <b> they're a huge hint whether something 'weird' had happened during the reaction or not</b>.
(carboxylation example?)
<h2> 2. Count carbons </h2>
When working with pericyclic reactions, especially rearrangements, it can get confusing very quickly. Therefore, it is my advice that you keep good track of your carbons, either by numbering them or keeping a mental snapshot of where they go.
<h2> 3. Look out for stereochemical inversions </h2>
